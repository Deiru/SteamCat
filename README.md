# SteamCat
Simple python script to aid in categorising Steam games based on data from external trackers

## Requirements  
* Latest Version of Python - https://www.python.org/downloads/  
* Preferred Text Editor (Notepad is fine, but Notepad++ is better)

## Before Starting
Make a backup of both your **localconfig.vdf** and your **sharedconfig.vdf** from your Steam directories. These can be found in:
* \<Install Directory\>\Steam\userdata\\<Steam3 ID\>\config\localconfig.vdf
* \<Install Directory\>\Steam\userdata\\<Steam3 ID\>\7\remote\remoteconfig.vdf

Default Install Directory for Steam is C:\Program Files x86\.

If you only have one account, there will only be one folder in \userdata\ - If you have used multiple accounts on your device, check your Steam3 ID using a tool such as https://steamdb.info/calculator/
